■■■■■■■■□ ● ● ● <h2> Snake Game </h2>
With a IA path generation, if the snake follow the path rules, it will never collide itself, and will surely win the game. \
The size of the map can only be incremented exponentially, because of the IA path, you just need to change the var -map_size-. \
\
A version with a pathfind already exists, i'll be upload that version someday.
